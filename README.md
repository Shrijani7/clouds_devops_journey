# 🌩️ #clouds_devops_journey

🎭 **The curtain rises on my cloud competence.**  
For so long, I've aspired to understand the way of the cloud — and now, the time has come.

🚀 I've challenged myself to embark on a **90-day learning journey** into the world of **Cloud & DevOps**.  
From infrastructure as code to CI/CD pipelines, from containers to cloud-native architecture — I’m diving in headfirst.

📌 Follow along as I document my progress, share insights, and grow from curious to cloud-confident.

Let the journey begin. ☁️💻
